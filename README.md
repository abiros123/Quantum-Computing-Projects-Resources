This repository is for all my projects and notes for Quantum Computing.
- Transverse Field Ising Model.ipynb
  - Ongoing project for the One-dimensional Ising model subroutine and implementing Flow equation techniques to solve for the energy spectra (which I will use Qiskit)
-QC Summer School Resources
  - Python Notebooks containing lectures from the MSU Summer School
- Qiskit Exercises.ipynb
  - Introductory notebook on exercises using Qiskit, derived from the IBM tutorial
- Ising Model Qiskit.ipynb
  - Ongoing project for the One-dimensional Ising model subroutine without any approximations like QAOA
